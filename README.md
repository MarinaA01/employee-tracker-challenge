# Employee Tracker

## Description

This employee tracker uses MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, and Inquirer@8.2.4 to create an employee tracking app. This app can do basic things such as view employee databases, and add to these databases. It was created for HR managers or whoever to be able to look at their employee database with easy access.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this app, you must have Node.js and other packages including MySQL available on your device (or simply watch the attached video).
